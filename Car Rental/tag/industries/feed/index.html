				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intros">When visiting the Netherlands for either vacation or work, you can always <a href="http://www.bblcarrental.com/car-rental-amsterdam-airport">rent a car at the airport</a>. However, if you want to rent at the airport you will often have to stand in line, and, it is very likely that the car you wanted to rent just got rented out to the person in front of you. Booking your car upfront at BB&amp;L Car Rental can prevent winding up with a car twice the size or the price you had in mind.</p>
<h4>Your car awaits</h4>
<p>Upon arrival at the airport in Holland you are one step ahead. While others stand in line, walk to the car rental parking lot or are transported in a car rental shuttle, you are awaited at the arrival hall by one of our BB&amp;L employees whom will guide you to your vehicle of choice, so you can arrive as fast as possible at your final destination. It&#8217;s that easy!</p>
<h4>Always the right rental car</h4>
<p>Without booking in advance there is no telling which car will be available. The rental car that you had in mind could be rented out already. Which most of the time leads to higher price range. When renting a car as a group it might happen that you have to settle with tighter seating and luggage spaces. But also when having special wishes such as <a href="http://www.bblcarrental.com/baby-child-seats">renting a child seat</a> or <a href="http://www.bblcarrental.com/winter-tires">snow chains</a>, it is possible the car rental has run out.</p>
<p>Do you want to be sure you get a rental car to your liking? With booking in advance you know you&#8217;re getting the right car.</p>
<h4>No price difference</h4>
<p>The biggest plus of the book in advance is of course knowing you’ll get the right car. You also know exactly what the costs are. When renting a car at the airport, there is no guarantee of getting a rental car in your price range. The most rented cars are often rented out during high season, thus you’re forced to rent in a higher price range. If you book upfront at BB&amp;L Car Rental you can enjoy 100% all inclusive rates and no nonsense terms.</p>
<h4>Renting a car abroad</h4>
<p>Renting abroad can be pretty tricky. Car rentals often advertise with all in prices, but when reading the terms, the car is not fully insured. Also the car price can be more expensive than you expected by having to take on multiple insurances. Therefore, always read the contract and make sure you really need all the extra insurances.</p>
